<h1> Happyland </h1>
<h2> Brief Description </h2>
<p> Happyland will be a tech demo of a boss fight. This shall include build up stages with weaker enemies, to then build up to a 2/3 stage boss battle! In Happyland all the surroundings look very cute and friendly but... get too close to the cute creatures and things can take a turn for the worse. </p>

<h2> Design Document </h2>

<h4> Map Layout </h4>
<p> The map is self contained and has walkable and non-walkable terrain, land and water. I have also added a bridge with multiple exits and large obstacles, this is to see how various pathfinding mechanisms might differ in the environment.

<h2> Weekly Development Log </h2>
<h4> 29/09/2022 </h4>
This week I have excluded the tutorial files from linter as they do not contribute to the final project. I have also made some design documents for 2 enemies that will be in the game, these enemies will have finite state machines. 

<h4> 22/09/2022 </h4>
<p> This week I have done the initial github setup as well as running through some ideas on paper to get my design document ready. I have also added the linter workflow to help with coding standards. I have imported various assets that I shall use for the environment, player and enemies for the project also. </p>
