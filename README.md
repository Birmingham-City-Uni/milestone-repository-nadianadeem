<h1> Happyland </h1>
<h2> Brief Description </h2>
<p> Happyland will be a tech demo of a boss fight. This shall include build up stages with weaker enemies, to then build up to a 2/3 stage boss battle! In Happyland all the surroundings look very cute and friendly but... get too close to the cute creatures and things can take a turn for the worse. </p>

<h2> Weekly Development Log </h2> 
<h4> 22/09/2022 </h4>
<p> This week I have done the initial github setup as well as running through some ideas on paper to get my design document ready. I have also added the linter workflow to help with coding standards. I have imported various assets that I shall use for the environment, player and enemies for the project also. </p>
